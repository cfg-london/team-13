# NOBEL PRIZE RECOMMENDATION ENGINE

## Motivation
A recommendation engine to suggest Nobel prizes related to a Nobel prize the website user is currently viewing. Inspired by recommendation engines used by Amazon and Netflix, with the aim to increase website user retention rates.

## Recommendation process
Uses a Redis cache to store how closely each Nobel prize correlates to other Nobel prizes. Properties we consider are:
- Subject of Nobel prize
- Country recognised for prize
- Motivation for the prize being awarded
- User traffic trends
- Nobel laureate details
